# Certif-Up Project Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to the Certif-Up project repository! This project aims to streamline and automate the certification process at Tek-Up. Below you'll find detailed information about each component and relevant links.

## Motivation
Tek-Up is renowned for its comprehensive certification process, enhancing professional and educational opportunities. However, the current certification process faces significant challenges:
- Multiple manual steps: checking the catalog, consulting with staff, obtaining study materials, taking white tests, and receiving vouchers.
- Delays and inefficiencies due to manual handling.
- Staff managing demands from over 2,000 students, resulting in delays and frustration.

## Solution
Certif-Up addresses these challenges by automating and streamlining the entire certification process. Key features include:
- **Dynamic Catalog**: A centralized, constantly updated online catalog of available certifications.
- **Online Study Materials**: Accessible study materials to reduce physical handovers.
- **Real-Time Availability**: Information on certification availability to prevent repeated inquiries.
- **Automated White Tests**: Online request and scheduling for white tests, with automated results tracking.
